### **AUF App Charter (v1.0)**

**Date:** 2025-07-26
**Primary Objective of Document:** To articulate the fundamental purpose, vision, core principles, scope, and architectural foundation of the Ai User Framework (AUF) Application, emphasizing its unique commitment to user agency and transparent, auditable AI collaboration.

---

#### **1. Vision Statement**

To empower humanity by transforming the Ai User Framework into an intuitive, resilient, and enduring digital partner that liberates cognitive resources and enables deep, sustained collaborative intelligence, with the user retaining unwavering control and transparent oversight of the entire process.

#### **2. Mission Statement**

To provide a seamless, local-first digital interface for the Ai User Framework, automating complex file operations, ensuring robust and user-owned data integrity, and intelligently managing auditable AI context, thereby eliminating cognitive friction and enabling any individual to harness the full potential of advanced AI collaboration under their explicit direction.

#### **3. Core Principles**

1.  **Cognitive Liberation:** Prioritize the reduction of user cognitive load by automating tedious workflows.
2.  **Uncompromised Data Integrity & Ownership:** Ensure absolute fidelity, transparency, and explicit user ownership of all data with an auditable trail.
3.  **Lean Architecture & Simplification:** Favor elegant, minimalist solutions over unnecessary complexity.
4.  **Absolute User Agency & Human Primacy:** The user is the ultimate architect, auditor, and decision-maker; the application never operates autonomously without explicit command.
5.  **Resilient Collaboration:** Design for LLM variability and failure modes, ensuring the AUF persona persists.
6.  **Pragmatic Viability:** Ground all technical decisions in real-world performance on current technology.
7.  **Host-Agnostic Accessibility (via Gateways):** Enable access to multiple LLM providers through 2nd-party gateways.

#### **4. Scope (MVP Definition)**

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is scoped to deliver core functionality and establish a robust foundation.

*   **INCLUDED:** Session Lifecycle Management, Automated Context Loading, Minimalist Chat Interface, Transactional Commit with Rollback, Modular API Management, Unified User Workflow, and a Local Deployment Model.
*   **EXCLUDED:** Persistent API Key Storage (pending research), Full User Account System, Rich Text Editing, Direct LLM Integrations (beyond gateways), Real-time Collaborative Features, Advanced Analytics Dashboards.

#### **5. Target User & Problem Solved**

*   **Target User:** The individual engaging in deep, iterative AI collaboration for systemic self-management, creative work, or complex problem-solving, who values absolute data ownership and transparent control.
*   **Problem Solved:** Addresses "Cognitive Friction and Overload" by eliminating manual file management and providing a protocol-driven, human-primacy focused interaction model with a user-owned, auditable memory.

#### **6. Key Architectural Pillars**

1.  **Local-First Data Model with User Sovereignty:** The user's local files are the database. The MVP is a free-to-use desktop application.
2.  **Technologies for Long-Term Resilience:** The stack will prioritize a unified codebase. **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) with Compose Multiplatform** is the leading candidate.
3.  **Secure & Predictable LLM Integration:** Access will be via 2nd-party gateways for cost predictability and flexibility. API keys are not persistently stored in the MVP.
4.  **Robust, Transparent Data Operations:** File writes are transactional with backups and schema validation. Context management is dynamic and user-visible.
